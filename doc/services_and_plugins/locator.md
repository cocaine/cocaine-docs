#Locator

##Description

Locator is a router and balancer in one face. When client connects to some service, Locator is the entry point, it knows all the services in the cloud and helps the client to be connected where it need.

As a router Locator acts the next manner. It collects information about all services in the cloud, where they are located and so on, and provides this information to the client. Decision of endpoint for client connection includes balancer data.

Balancer knows about load on all services in the cloud. If there are some versions of any app, balancer also knows how much load (in percent) it should provide to each version.
