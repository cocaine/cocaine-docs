# Unicorn service plugin
## Description
This plugin is a key-value storage. It uses [ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) as a backend thus do not use this service as a database. 

Service allows to:
  * Store any data, that can be serialized with the [msgpack](http://msgpack.org/) and compatible with ZooKeeper applicability. For example, you can use it to store the app configuration parameters.
  * Use publish/subscribe way to be consistent with the data changes.
  * Create a global distributed lock.

Read the [ZooKeeper overview](http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/zookeeperOver.html) to learn the basic terms such as a ``node``.

Service does not support some features of ZooKeeper. For example, you cannot store values in nodes that have children.

## Handles

|Handle|Description|
|------|-----------|
| [children_subscribe](#children_subscribe) | Subscribe for node children. |
| [close](#close) | Stop communication with ``Unicorn`` service. |
| [create](#create) | Create node. |
| [remove](#remove) | Delete a node. |
| [del](#del) | Delete a node. Deprecated, because "del" is a reserved word in Python |

### children_subscribe

Subscribes for the node children creation/deletion.

```
children_subscribe(path)
```

**Parameters**

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------|----|-----------|
|path|string|Path to the node with the children.|

**Return value**

Messages:
  * Stream of "value" with vector of deleted/created node names. ``Unicorn`` sends this vector for each new of deleted child.
  * "error" with an error description. Errors are unrecoverable and communication with ``Unicorn`` will be stopped.


### close

Stops communication with ``Unicorn`` service. It stops subscriptions and releases locks. Also ``Unicorn`` will not answer to any of your messages after it.

```
close()
```

### create

Creates node with the specified value of the version 0.

```
create(string path, variant value)
```

**Parameters**

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------|----|-----------|
|path|string|Node path.|
|value|variant|Data to store.|

**Return value**

Messages:
  * "value" with True.
  * "error" with an error description.

### del

Deletes a node if version matches.

```
del(path, version)
```

**Parameters**

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------|----|-----------|
|path|string|Node path.|
|version|unsigned int|Version of node.|

**Return value**

Messages:
  * "value" with True.
  * "error" with an error description.

### get

Gets value of the specified node.

```
get(path)
```

**Parameters**

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------|----|-----------|
|path|string|Path to the node that has no children.|

**Return value**

Messages:
  * "value" with the tuple(value, version).
  * "error" with an error description. Errors are unrecoverable and communication with ``Unicorn`` will be stopped.

### increment
 
 Increments node's data by the specified value. If one of operand is non-numeric returns error, if one operand is floating point returns floating point, otherwise returns int. Value can be negative. 

```
increment(string path, variant value)
```

**Parameters**

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------|----|-----------|
|path|string|Node path.|
|value|variant|Value can have integer or floating point type.|

**Return value**

Messages:
  * "value" with the tuple(value, version) contains new values.
  * "error" with an error description.
   
### lock

Creates a lock on the specified node. Do not use the specified path for other purposes. If lock is acquired other app blocks until lock is released. Automatically released on disconnection.

```
lock(path)
```

**Parameters**

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------|----|-----------|
|path|string|Node path.|

**Return value**

Messages:
  * "value" with True.
  * "error" with an error description.

### put

Puts the value to the specified node. 

```     
put(path, value, version)
```

**Parameters**

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------|----|-----------|
|path|string|Node path.|
|value|variant|Data to store.|
|version|unsigned int|Version of a data.|

**Return value**

Messages:
  * "value" with the tuple(bool, value, version). 
    * ``Bool`` equals ``True`` if value was stored or ``False`` if ``Unicorn`` contains value of upper version. 
    * ``Value`` contains currently stored data. ``Version`` contains currently stored version.
  * "error" with an error description.

### subscribe

Subscribes for specified node.

```
subscribe(path)
```

**Parameters**

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------|----|-----------|
|path|string|Path to the node that has no children.|

**Return value**

Messages:
  * Stream of "value" with the tuple(value, version). ``Unicorn`` will send updates of value as the version upped.
  * "error" with an error description. Errors are unrecoverable and communication with ``Unicorn`` will be stopped.

## Configuration
Unicorn backends should be configured in "unicorns" section of cocaine.conf file. Each instance has a name, to refer to in other config sections as key and object consisting of type ("zookeeper" is the only one implementation in this plugin) and type specific args as value. Zookeeper backend has the following args:
  * endpoints - endpoints for zookeeper. Array of objects with "host" and "port".
  * prefix is a namespace appended to all paths in unicorn, so it should start from '/'. 
  * recv_timeout_ms is a timeout for receive operation, passed to zookeeper c library as is.
Example:  

```
"unicorns": {
 "core": {
  "type": "zookeeper",
  "args":{
   "endpoints": [{"host":"localhost","port":2181}, ...],
   "prefix": "/prefix",
   "recv_timeout_ms": 5000
  }
 }, ...
}
```

Unicorn service should be configured in [services section](../maintenance_server_configuration.md#services) of Cocaine configuration file via preconfigured backends as follows:  

```
"unicorn": {
    "type": "unicorn",
    "args":{
        "backend": "core"
    }
}
```

###Arguments

|Argument|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|endpoints|Array of ZooKeeper endpoints. ``Unicorn`` use "localhost:2181" by default.|
    
##Cocaine internals
``Unicorn`` plugin also can be used for internal Cocaine needs:
  * Cocaine can store any management data.
  * Cocaine can use ``Unicorn`` as a discovery service in ``Locator``.

### Locator discovery

Plugin provides ``cocaine::cluster::unicorn_cluster_t`` class.  ``Locator`` can use it as a cluster interface for discovery functionality.
Discovery works in a following way:
  * On ``Locator`` announce ``Unicorn`` puts ``$prefix/$uuid`` node with serialized endpoints as a value. ``Unicorn`` checks announce every ``check_interval`` seconds.  If something goes wrong plugin retries to announce every ``retry_interval`` seconds.
  * Each ``Locator`` also subscribes for children on ``prefix`` node. For each node addition/deletion ``Unicorn`` calls ``drop_node/link_node``. It checks that list is valid every ``check_interval`` seconds and retries in case of failure every ``retry_interval`` seconds.

###Configuration

To use ``Unicorn`` service for ``Locator`` discovery purpose administrator should configure ``Locator`` as follows:

```
"locator": {
    "type": "locator",
    "hostname" : "localhost",
    "endpoint" : "127.0.0.1",
    "port" : "10054",
    "args": {
        "cluster": {
            "type": "unicorn",
            "args": {
                "backend": "core"
                "retry_interval": 1,
                "check_interval": 60
            }
        }
    }
}
```

``Unicorn`` configuration contains three arguments:

|Argument|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|backend|Preconfigured backend of unicorn from "unicorns" section of cocaine configuration file.|
|retry_interval|Interval to retry in case of failure. 1 second by default.|
|check_interval|Check interval of regular order. 60 seconds by default.|
